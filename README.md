This is a simple calculator app that can calculate mathematical expression.

### Supported mathematical operators
  * +, plus (addition).
  * -, minus (subtraction).
  * /, obelus (division).
  * Ã—, times (multiplication).
  * %, modulus (division remainder).
  * (), parentheses (calculation priority).
  * =, equals (calculation).

### Additional input functionality
  * DEL, delete - deleting the current active symbol.
  * <>, back/forward - changing the active symbol. This allows for deleting or adding symbols at any point in the expression.

### Customization ('CUSTOMISE' button)
  * Position - on click the target button becomes active (it's border changes to dashed). You can swap it's place with any of the other buttons (except for 'CUSTOMISE' and '=' ) by clicking on the new position. 'CUSTOMISE' and '=' buttons are with fixed position.
  * Color - in the top right corner each button (except for 'CUSTOMISE') has a color picker with which you can change it's color. Changing the color of '=' button automaticaly changes the color of 'CUSTOMISE' button and the border color of all number buttons so they match.
